# simple-travel-agency-manager

This C program is a simple employee/driver manager for a travel agency.

This program takes input following details of three drivers working at the company :-

1. Name

2. Driving License Number

3. Route

4. Kilometres travelled

Then the program displays the details of the drivers in a beautiful fashion.

Note:- There can be still better logics but I have used structures as a beginner.
